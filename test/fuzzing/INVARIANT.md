## When creates a proposal
- The borrower balances are updated:
    Balance(collateral) = previous - collateralAmount
	Balance(sdex) = previous - fee
    Balance(credit) = previous
- The spro balance is updated:
	Balance(collateral) = previous + collateralAmount
    Balance(credit) = previous
- _proposalNonce == number of proposal
- The dead address balance is updated:
	Balance(sdex) = previous + fee

## When creates a loan
- The lender balance is updated:
    Balance(credit) = previous - loanTerms.creditAmount
    Balance(collateral) = previous
- The borrower balance is updated:
	Balance(credit) = previous + loanTerms.creditAmount
    Balance(collateral) = previous
- Not possible to accept a loan after the start date:	startTimestamp > block.timestamp
- The proposal amount is at least >= the minimum
- The rest in the proposal must be greater than the proposal minAmount

## Loans
- The amount of collateral in the proposal should be >= of the required amount from loans

## Cancel proposal
- The borrower can withdraw the unused part of his collateral at anytime: Borrower balance(collateral) + _withdrawableCollateral[proposalHash]
- After cancellation, the lender cannot use this proposal to create a loan: ProposalDoesNotExists();

## ClaimLoan
- Lenders can't claim collateral before end time : revert LoanRunning()
- The lender cannot claim borrowToken if borrower already sent tokens: revert CallerNotLoanTokenHolder()
- The lender balance is updated if loan repaid:
	Balance(credit) = previous + loan.principalAmount + loan.fixedInterestAmount
	Balance(collateral) = previous
- The lender balance is updated if loan expired:
    Balance(credit) = previous
    Balance(collateral) = previous + collateralAmount
- The spro balance is updated if loan repaid:
	Balance(credit) = previous - loan.principalAmount - loan.fixedInterestAmount
    Balance(collateral) = previous
- The spro balance is updated if loan expired:
    Balance(credit) = previous
    Balance(collateral) = previous - collateralAmount

## Repay
- The borrower can't repay before the start date but anytime after
- The borrower balance is updated:
    Balance(credit) = previous - loan.principalAmount - loan.fixedInterestAmount
    Balance(collateral) = previous + collateralAmount
- The lender balance is updated if transfer success:
	Balance(credit) = previous + loan.principalAmount + loan.fixedInterestAmount
	Balance(credit) = before the lent + loan.fixedInterestAmount
    Balance(collateral) = previous
- The lender balance is updated if transfer failed:
	Balance(credit) = previous
- The lender balance is updated:
    Balance(collateral) = previous
- The spro balance is updated if transfer success:
	Balance(credit) = previous
    Balance(collateral) = previous - collateralAmount
- The spro balance is updated if transfer failed:
	Balance(credit) = previous + loan.principalAmount + loan.fixedInterestAmount
    Balance(collateral) = previous - collateralAmount

## Global
- The balance of the Spro is equal to the available credit limit from the open proposal, plus the loan amount and interest if the loan status is 'PAID_BACK'.
